Create a minimal full-stack web app that lets musicians generate customized pitch emails to establishments that host live music using the OpenAI GPT-4 API.

Frontend:
- A simple HTML + javascript form with the following input fields:
  1. Info Dump (textarea) — Instructions: “Include as much detail as possible to help the AI write a compelling pitch email in your voice.”
  2. 1–3 Live Performance Video Links — Each should have its own input field. Only one (the best fit) — Only one at a time will be used in each unique email
  3. Preferred Email Personality Style (dropdown or text input, e.g., friendly, serious, confident, witty)
  4. Name + Phone Number for Email Signature (textarea)
  5. Availability for Next 3 Months (textarea)

- A “Generate Pitch Email/s” button
- After submission, the app should display the generated email in a large textarea so users can copy it easily

Backend:
- Use Node.js with Express
- Add a POST endpoint `/generate-email` that:
  - Accepts the form inputs
  - Sends them to OpenAI GPT-4 via API
  - Uses the following template prompt structure for GPT:

You are a helpful AI writing expert who crafts persuasive booking pitch emails for musicians to get booked at establishments that host live music. I use the word establishments because some could be restaurants, or coffee shops, for example

Write a pitch email from a musician to an establishment that hosts live music - it should sound authentic and compelling. The tone of the email should match the style provided. Use the info dump to capture their personality and music identity.

Rules:

Use only ONE of the provided video links at a time / 1 max per email 

The salutation must use this placeholder: “Hi {{firstname}}” - DO NOT add a comma

The email body can use the placeholder {{venue}} as needed, but never in the greetin. Availability provided should be listed in the email body as well as a call to action to lock in dates for a booking always


End the email with the signature

INPUTS:
Artist Messaging: {{infoDump}}
Video Links: {{videoLinks}}
Tone Style: {{emailStyle}}
Signature: {{signatureBlock}}
Availability: {{availability}}

Write a short, effective email in that artist's voice.
